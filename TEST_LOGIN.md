# Login Testing Instructions

## Authentication Fixed âœ…

The login functionality has been implemented and should now work. Here's what was fixed:

### What was wrong:
- The signin form had placeholder `TODO` functions that didn't actually authenticate
- All auth buttons just navigated to the next screen without doing any authentication

### What was fixed:
1. **Connected signin form to auth service** - Now uses the actual `authService.login()` and `authService.register()` functions
2. **Added proper error handling** - Shows error messages if login fails
3. **Added loading states** - Button shows "Please wait..." during authentication
4. **Added form validation** - Checks email and password requirements
5. **Fixed type casting** - Properly handles ZodiacSign types

### How to test:
1. **Sign Up**: Enter any email/password (6+ chars) and select "Sign Up"
2. **Sign In**: Use the same credentials to sign in
3. **Error Cases**: Try invalid passwords (<6 chars) to see error handling

### Mock API:
- Uses mock authentication for development
- Automatically creates demo users when you sign up
- Stores data in AsyncStorage

## App Icon Issue

The app.json is correctly configured to use `./assets/icon.png`. The icon files exist:
- `icon.png` (1.3MB) - Main app icon
- `app-logo.png` (1.3MB) - Same size, probably identical
- All other icons are present

### To fix icon display:
1. Try clearing Expo cache: `expo start -c`
2. Make sure you're testing on device/simulator that shows app icons
3. Check if it's a development vs production issue

## Test Steps:
1. `npm start` (already running)
2. Open app in simulator/device
3. Try the login flow with email/password
4. Check if app icon appears in device app drawer
